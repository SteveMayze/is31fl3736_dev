# IS31FL3736 Development Board

This project is to develop a prototype for reviewing the IS31FL3736 12Ã—8 DOTS MATRIX LED DRIVER WITH INDIVIDUAL AUTO BREATH FUNCTION from [Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc](www.issi.com)
 The basic goals of this project is to create a simple board with an array of RGB leds to see what is involved to control the LEDs as per the writeup in the datasheet. Things of interest will be
 
 1. Simplicity of use (firmware)
 1. Simplicity of the layout
 1. The effective power consumption
 1. The footprint size.
